\subsubsection{Qualitative Analysis}

Here we show sample ranked lists (top-k) for multiple MOOCs, and discuss the quality of the results. We want to show that they can indeed be useful to help learners assess the pre-requisite and the major concepts taught in a module. 

\subsubsection{Quantitative Analysis}

Here we use the Text Retrieval MOOC to do quantitative evaluation, mainly to compare different methods and see which method is the best or examine how we can improve the accuracy. But we can also quantify the accuracy to understand the utility of the proposed methods. 
This should allow us to draw conclusions about which method/idea works the best.

\subsubsection{Error analysis}

Do some analysis to understand where the proposed methods make mistakes. This helps identifying additional challenges for future study.
