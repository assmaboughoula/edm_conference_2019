As independent learning continues to climb in popularity, it is increasingly important to provide learners with tools to help learners with decision making and independent curriculum planning. To this end, we propose to automatically build concept profiles for online learning modules, which consist of two kinds of concepts: 1) Elemental Concepts which are basic concepts used in a learning module, but not explained in the module and thus are useful for helping a learner assess whether the learner has the needed background to learn the module. 2) Composite Concepts which are advanced concepts representing the major topics explained in the module and thus serve as a useful preview of the concepts that a learner can expect to learn from the module. We propose and study methods for discovering and identifying Elemental and Composite concepts from instructional text data such as textbooks and MOOC video lecture transcripts to build a Concept Profile for a learning module. Evaluation results on several Coursera MOOCs show promising results of the proposed methods, demonstrating the feasibility of automatic construction of useful concept profiles for online learning modules.
