\section{Methods for Concept Profiling}
\subsection{Overview}

Here we give a high-level description of the overall method which consists of two steps: 1) extraction of concepts and 2) further extraction of elemental concepts and composite concepts.

\subsection{Concept Extraction}

Here, we describe our method for concept extraction. Can the neural network be applied here? 

We could say that we just use existing methods for this step, but if there's anything interesting to say here, e.g., using NN, or leveraging book index as training data, we should say that. 

\subsection{Discovery of Elemental and Composite Concepts}

Here we describe the proposed (new) methods for discovering the two kinds of concepts. 

Since this is a new challenge, we should devote most of our effort here to improve the methods. We may also propose multiple strategies if possible.
